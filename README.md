# ZenCloudKit v.0.1
 
 ZenCloudKit is a framework intended to facilitate the use of native
 CloudKit framework, rendering unified interface which could be
 implemented in projects that employ CoreData (though CoreData is not
 a requirement), making it much easier for developer to implement
 basic (as well as more advanced) operations, such as saving, deleting
 and syncing objects to/with CloudKit, including references and push
 notifications management.
