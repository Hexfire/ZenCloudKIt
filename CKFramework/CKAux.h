 CKFramework v.0.1 (beta)
 
 CKFramework is a framework intended to facilitate the use of native
 CloudKit framework, rendering unified interface which could be
 implemented in projects that employ CoreData (though CoreData is not
 a requirement), making it much easier for developer to implement
 basic (as well as more advanced) operations, such as saving, deleting
 and syncing objects to/with CloudKit, including references and push
 notifications management.
 
 Currently is in beta. Some issues are known and pending update.

 CKAux.h
 
 Auxiliary Objective-C code.
 
 For instance, Swift lacks exception handling support, but one is required
 particularly when creating CKDatabase instance (which may fail and lead
 to exception being thrown)
